/* What the app is allowed to do without being asked.

   Every feature in this journal so far has had the same shape: a person decides
   something happened, and the app writes it down. Automation breaks that shape.
   The app decides something happened. That is a genuinely different kind of
   power, and in a health record it is a dangerous one — the whole value of six
   months of data is that somebody can look at a bad fortnight and trust what it
   says. An automation that guesses wrong does not lose a data point; it puts a
   plausible fiction in the middle of the evidence, and there is no way to tell
   afterwards which rows were guesses.

   So automations here run under one contract, and every entry in the registry
   below has to satisfy all five clauses:

   1. **It only concludes things the device actually observed.** Not "you
      probably ate lunch at one" — the app does not know that. "Your phone
      stopped seeing satellites" is an observation; what it implies is stated as
      an implication.

   2. **Whatever it writes is labelled as its own, permanently.** A session the
      app ended carries `estimated: true` for the rest of its life, and every
      surface that draws it says so. Confirming it does not launder it into a
      measurement.

   3. **It asks once, and taking no notice is a valid answer.** The question is
      one tap with a correction behind it. Ignoring it forever leaves a labelled
      estimate, which is a fine thing for a record to contain. Nothing nags, and
      nothing is deleted for want of an answer.

   4. **It is switchable, individually, in a list that names what it watches.**
      Not one "smart features" toggle. A person who wants their sun sessions to
      close themselves and wants nothing else inferred can have exactly that.

   5. **It never sends anything anywhere.** Every automation here runs on the
      device against data the device already has. Two features in this app do
      make outbound requests — the daily weather in lib/context, and the
      calendar in lib/googleCalendar — and each runs under its own consent,
      outside this registry, precisely so that clause stays true. No automation
      may add a request, and neither of those two may become one: the calendar
      is pulled when somebody presses something, never on a schedule, which is
      what keeps it out of this file.

   The fifth clause is why this file is a registry rather than a framework.
   There is no scheduler, no rules engine, no queue. Each automation is a pure
   function living beside the feature it belongs to; this module exists so there
   is one place that lists them, one place that stores whether each is on, and
   one place where the contract above is written down for the next person who
   wants to add one. */
