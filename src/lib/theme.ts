/* Design tokens + theme switching.

   The app is one large single-file surface (src/App.tsx) that reads colours as
   `C.something` at render time rather than destructuring them once. That makes
   a theme swap cheap: mutate the token object in place, re-render the tree, and
   every surface picks up the new palette. The same values are mirrored onto
   :root as CSS custom properties so plain stylesheet rules (index.css, the
   global <style> block, scrollbars, selection colours) stay in sync from one
   source of truth.

   Dark is the default. Light is a first-class option, not an afterthought, and
   the choice is remembered in localStorage — it has to be readable *before*
   React mounts (see the inline script in index.html) so the first paint is
   already the right colour instead of flashing white. */

   Soft Clinical. The reference is a well-made paper notebook and a calm
   clinic waiting room, not a hospital chart and not a SaaS dashboard.

   Dark is **soft graphite**: a warm-neutral charcoal, deliberately not the
   blue-black that every developer tool ships. Surfaces lift by a few points of
   lightness; borders are visible rather than hairline, because the neobrutalist
   half of the brief needs an edge it can thicken.

   Light is **warm off-white** — paper, with a faint cream cast — rebuilt at
   the same structure rather than inverted from dark.

   The accent family is muted blue (primary), sage (steady/positive), lavender
   (anything the AI touched) and clay (the earthier of the two new tracking
   categories). They are chosen to sit next to each other in a chart without
   competing, and to stay calm at large fill sizes.

   Accent fills always carry `onAccent` text; `accentText` is the separate,
   contrast-checked value for accent-coloured *text* on a page background.

   The ink ramp is ink > sub > subtle > muted, and the last step is not a
   fourth shade of text. `muted` is the *placeholder* colour and is solved to
   the 3:1 bar that placeholders and disabled states are held to — it does not
   clear the 4.5:1 that body text needs, on any surface, in either theme
   (measured 3.17-4.32:1 across card, faint and page). So `subtle` is the
   quietest colour anything readable may be set in; `muted` belongs to ghost
   text in an empty field, an `is-unset` value and a struck-through done step,
   where the point is that there is nothing there yet.

   Thirteen rules and four call sites had it colouring real content — the unit
   beside a dose, the day initials over the week strip, the labels saying which
   photo is on which side of the comparison slider. They are `subtle` now.

   In dark mode the accent is a *light* blue carrying dark ink, not a saturated
   fill carrying white. Two reasons: white-on-blue can only clear AA if the blue
   is dark enough to look muddy against graphite, and a chunky light-on-dark
   button is what makes the neobrutalist press feel tactile instead of heavy. */
