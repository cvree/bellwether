/* Personal experiments — a real question, and the smallest thing that could
   answer it.

   People arrive at a health journal with a question, not a dataset. *Does
   morning sunlight relate to better sleep? Does coffee after two make the night
   worse? Did anything change after I started that cream?* Every one of those is
   answerable from data this app already has, and every one of them is
   ordinarily answered by scrolling back through six weeks of entries and
   guessing.

   An experiment here is four things: a factor, an outcome, a lag, and a way of
   splitting the days in two. That is all. The design decisions worth stating:

   **The split is the person's own median, not a threshold from a guideline.**
   "Days with 15+ minutes outside" is chosen because *this person* has a run of
   days above and below that line, so both halves exist. A fixed threshold
   produces experiments with three days on one side, which is the commonest way
   an n-of-1 tool produces a confident nonsense.

   **Nothing is reported until the ladder in ./evidence says so.** A card in
   Collecting is not a result with a caveat, it is a progress bar and a count.
   The result text does not exist yet. That is why watching one fill up is the
   good part: the app is visibly refusing to guess.

   **Every sentence is a comparison of the person's own averages.** "On
   mornings with 15+ minutes outside, your later sleep rating has averaged 0.9
   points higher" is a fact about their journal, checkable by hand. It never
   becomes "morning light improves your sleep", and `EXPERIMENT_COPY` holds
   every phrase this module can emit so the causal-language audit can read them
   all in one place.

   **A before/after experiment is a different shape and is treated as one.**
   "Did anything change after I started this cream" has no high and low days,
   it has a date. It gets its own comparison and its own, sharper limitation:
   time passed, seasons turned, and everything else in a life moved too. */

/** Where to cut the days in two.

    Not the median — the cut that actually *divides*, which is a different

    A factor people really track is rarely a smooth spread. It is nine glasses
    of water on the days you remember and two on the days you don't, and often
    not in equal numbers: eighty days at nine and forty at two. The median of
    that is nine, and a strict "above the line" test then puts all hundred and
    twenty days *below* it and compares a hundred and twenty against nothing.
    The experiment looks like it is working and is comparing one group to the
    empty set.

    So the split is chosen from the values that are actually present, and the
    one picked is whichever leaves the two halves closest in size. On evenly
    spread data that lands on the median anyway; on the water case it lands on
    two, which is exactly what somebody means by "the days I had a lot".
