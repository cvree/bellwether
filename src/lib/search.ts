/* Search: one box over the whole journal.

   A journal that has been kept for a year is a filing cabinet, and until now
   this app gave you no way to open a drawer. "When did I last take the
   antihistamine?" "What did I eat the week of the flare?" "Which days was the
   itch a 9?" — every one of those questions had the same answer, which was to
   scroll History with your thumb and hope.

   So: one field, everything in it.

   Four decisions hold this module together.

   1. **It is a pure function of the journal.** `buildIndex` turns the database
      into a flat list of documents; `runSearch` ranks that list against a
      parsed query. Neither touches storage, the network, React, or the clock
      except through a `today` string it is handed. That is what makes the
      whole thing testable, and it is why the screen over it is thin.

   2. **A record is one document, and it carries its own way back.** Every hit
      knows the screen it belongs to and the date to open it on, so a result is
      never a dead end. That includes the ones that are not records at all —
      the questions the journal asks, and the screens themselves — because
      "where is the backup button" is a search somebody makes, and answering it
      with nothing would be a worse answer than the truth.

   3. **The query language is small, guessable, and never in the way.** Plain
      words work and are the overwhelming majority of searches. On top of that
      sit five things people already type into search boxes elsewhere: quotes
      for a phrase, `is:` for a kind, `on:`/`before:`/`after:`/`last:` for
      dates, `-word` to exclude, and — the one this app actually needed —
      `pain>7`, a comparison against a question by its own name. Anything that
      does not parse as a filter is treated as a word, so a query is never
      rejected and a stray colon never costs somebody their search.

   4. **Every term must match.** AND, not OR. A search for "hamburger cheese"
      that returned every meal containing either would be a list nobody reads.
      Where the terms matched decides the ranking; whether they all matched
      decides membership.

   Nothing here leaves the device. This is the opposite of the import path:
   it is an index built in memory, over data already on the phone, thrown away
   when the screen closes. */
