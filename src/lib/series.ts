/* One question, asked of everything: what was this on that day?

   The journal now holds seven different shapes of data — survey answers,
   meals, bowel movements, doses, sun sessions, environmental context, lab
   results — and every one of them reduces to a number per day in its own way.
   Before this module, each surface that wanted to compare two of them had to
   know about all seven.

   So this is the seam. Hand it the slices of the database and it hands back a
   flat list of *variables*, each with a label, a unit, a direction and one
   method: `value(date)`. From there an experiment comparing morning sunlight
   against sleep quality does not know or care that one side came from a GPS
   and a solar model and the other from somebody tapping a 7.

   It sits above `./metrics` (which already unified food, bowel and routine)
   rather than replacing it, because that registry is what the chart and the
   metric picker already read and there was no reason to move them. */
