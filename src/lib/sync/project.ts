/* Turning the journal into records, and back.

   The app stores one blob and syncs many rows, so something has to translate.
   Doing that translation *here*, purely, rather than inside the engine is what
   lets the interesting question — "does a phone and a laptop editing the same
   Tuesday converge?" — be answered by a unit test in a millisecond.

   Two rules govern what crosses the wire.

   **Identity is semantic.** An entry's sync id is its date. The local `id`
   field is a random string minted on whichever device happened to create the
   day first, so two devices that both log Tuesday mint two different ones. Sync
   on those and Tuesday exists twice, forever. Sync on the date and it exists
   once, which is what the user believes.

   **Some things are about the device, not about the person.** Sound and haptic
   preferences, the AI provider connection, whether this browser has been
   granted notification permission, when *this* device last downloaded a backup
   — those describe a machine, and pushing them would mean turning sound on for
   someone's laptop because they turned it on for their phone. They stay home.
   Everything that describes the *journal* — the survey, the questions, the
   reminders, the goals — travels. */

   a tombstone of a kind nothing on this side had ever heard of, so the delete
