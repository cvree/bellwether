/* The shapes cross-device sync is built on.

   The journal on disk is one JSON blob — that is what makes local saves
   instant, and it is not changing. Sync needs the opposite: the smallest unit
   that two devices can disagree about. So the blob is *projected* into records
   on the way out and folded back in on the way in, and this file is the
   contract between those two views.

   Three decisions are pinned down here, and everything else follows from them.

   1. **Identity is semantic, not accidental.** A daily entry's sync id is its
      date. Two phones that both log Tuesday produce one Tuesday, not two —
      without that, "no duplicate entries" is unachievable, because the local
      `id` field is a random string minted independently on each device.
   2. **Deletion is a record.** A row that vanishes is indistinguishable from a
      row that has not arrived yet, so deletions are written down as tombstones
      and travel like any other change. Anything less loses the delete the next
      time the other device pushes.
   3. **The clock is honest about being a clock.** `updatedAt` is wall time from
      whichever device made the edit, and devices disagree about wall time. So
      ordering is (updatedAt, rev, deviceId) — the last two exist purely to make
      ties resolve to the *same* answer everywhere, rather than to a different
      one on each device. */

/** The collections that sync.

    Photo blobs are not on this list and never will be: they are two or three
    orders of magnitude larger than everything else here, they are optional, and
    they travel on their own path (see engine.syncPhotos). Reports are absent
    for the opposite reason — they are derived from entries, so syncing them
    would be syncing the same facts twice. */
