/* The Appointment Pack.

   Ten minutes with a specialist, once every few months, is the moment this
   whole journal is *for*. What it has to survive is the question "so how have
   you been?" — asked while the person is nervous, on a paper gown, trying to
   summarise a hundred and twenty days from memory. Memory answers with the
   last bad week, because that is what memory does.

   So the pack is not another export. An export hands over rows and asks the
   reader to do the arithmetic; this does the arithmetic and hands over the
   answer, on paper, in the order a consultation actually runs: how it has been,
   what the days were like, what the bad stretches were, what changed, what is
   being taken, what it looks like, what happened, and — last, because it is the
   part that is *theirs* — what they want to ask.

   Everything here is pure and takes the day it should call today. Four rules
   govern the numbers:

   1. **Nothing is invented.** A figure with nothing behind it is omitted with
      its reason recorded, never printed as a zero. "No flares recorded" and
      "no flares happened" are different sentences and only the first one is
      knowable.
   2. **A comparison needs both sides.** The previous window is the same number
      of days immediately before the range. If either side is too thin, the
      change is null — a "+2.1" built on three days against thirty is a lie
      with a decimal point in it.
   3. **Coverage travels with every average.** Any clinician reading "5.8" is
      entitled to know it came from 22 days out of 30, and the pack never makes
      them ask.
   4. **The app does not grade anybody.** Adherence is a count of what was
      recorded against what the plan asks for. It is not a score, it carries no
      colour, and the reading of it belongs to the two people in the room. */
