/* The first two minutes.

   Somebody has just installed a health journal, which means something is
   wrong — or they are afraid something might be. They do not want a product
   tour. They want to believe this will be worth the effort, and then they want
   to put something down.

   So this is not a wizard, and there is no longer a door marked "set
   everything up in detail instead". A door like that is an admission: it says
   the fast path is the cheap one and the real setup is somewhere else, and it
   makes the person who most needs help choose, on screen two, between being
   rushed and being buried. There is one path now, it is the good one, and it
   is composed as nine screens — a doorway, six numbered acts, and a birth:

     1. **The promise.** One line, and a glimpse of a journal already alive —
        a rating, a photograph, a note, a trend, a flare that ended. The claim
        the app is making, shown rather than explained. The privacy facts are
        one tap below it, before anything has been typed.
     2. **Who this is for.** A name and an age, both refusable, neither
        numbered — this is a doorway, not step one of anything. It is here
        because everything after it is warmer for having been asked: the app
        greets them by name every morning, and the two facts a clinician asks
        for first are already at the top of anything they print. The screen
        says exactly what each one buys, out loud, and then leaves the door
        open — because a journal that guilts you on screen two is one you stop
        opening on day four.
     3. **The only question that cannot be defaulted.** What are you tracking?
     4. **What they came here to find out.** The question behind the tracking —
        triggers, a trend, whether a treatment is doing anything, a page to
        take to an appointment. It is asked here because it is the one answer
        that makes every screen after it different, and because a person who
        has just named their own question reads the next four screens as work
        towards it rather than as setup.
     5. **What it will ask you** — one group of questions at a time, with the
        ones that answer their question marked as such.
     6. **What is worth a photograph** — one subject at a time.
     7. **What else it should keep** — one thing at a time, then how often it
        should ask, then whether it should nudge.
     8. **The first entry.** Real, not a demo. The number they pick is written
        to their journal.
     9. **The journal beginning.** The card they just filled in physically
        becomes the first card on their timeline, the rail draws itself
        downward into the days they have not lived yet, the streak counts to
        one — and then the app answers the only question a person actually has
        at the end of a setup: *when does this start being worth it*. Three
        dated milestones, computed from their own cadence against the same
        evidence ladder the rest of the app is graded on. Not "keep going and
        it will be worth it". A date.

   And one screen that is not part of the path, offered from the end of it:
   **bringing in what they have already written.** Almost nobody arrives at a
   health journal having tracked nothing — it is in a notes file, a chat with
   themselves, a photograph of a page. A journal that starts with one day when
   it could have started with ninety is the single largest thing this flow can
   still do for somebody, and it is worth exactly one card at the end to say
   so.

   ---------- why acts five, six and seven are all walked ----------

   They used to be lists. Each list arrived pre-answered — a "Quick / Balanced
   / Thorough" preset on the questions, a set of suggestions ticked on the
   extras — with a guided pass offered *beside* it for anybody who wanted one.

   That was the wrong shape twice over.

   The first problem is the preset. Three unlabelled sizes is a slider with no
   units, and whichever one the app lands on is the app deciding what somebody
   tracks: the person most likely to tap "Thorough" is the person least likely
   to still be answering it in March, and the person who taps nothing at all
   has had a check-in chosen for them by a default. A journal is not a settings
   screen. What goes in it has to be picked, question by question, by the
   person who is going to answer it at 7am on the morning they feel worst.

   The second problem is the door beside the door. A guided pass that is
   optional is a guided pass that the people who need it never take, because
   taking it means admitting on screen five that you would like some help. So
   there is no list any more and no preset to arrive on. Every one of these
   three acts *is* its pass: one card, one decision, a plain way to say no, and
   the running cost of the whole thing under your thumb. Six short decisions
   instead of one long list — and, more to the point, six decisions somebody
   actually made.

   And nothing is confirmed at the end of one. A review card after a pass that
   asked about every single item is the app asking somebody to agree with
   themselves; it reads as doubt, and the second reading of a list you have
   just built is the reading where you stop caring. The last answer is the
   answer. The next act starts.

   Four rules hold the middle acts together:

   - **Nothing is ever demanded.** Every card can be moved past. "Not this one"
     is a real button on every screen that offers a yes, and the primary action
     is never greyed out waiting for compliance.
   - **Nothing is ever assumed.** No question, and no photograph, is switched
     on by anything other than a tap. Where the packs have an opinion it is
     drawn as a suggestion, marked as one, and left alone until somebody
     answers.
   - **The default is the small one.** Where a screen has to guess, it guesses
     short. Nobody ever quit a journal because the first week asked too little,
     and every one of these screens can be reopened from Settings with more on
     the table than first run ever showed.
   - **Every choice shows its consequence immediately.** Switching a question
     on changes the "about 25 seconds a day" line under it. Typing a name
     changes the greeting quoted underneath it. Choosing a photo subject puts a
     frame on the contact sheet. Saying yes to meals puts a button in the row
     under your thumb. Nothing is filed away to be discovered later; the app is
     assembled in front of the person making it.

   And one rule holds the personal screen on its own:

   - **Encouraged, never extracted.** Every optional thing this flow asks for
     says what it is for, in the same breath, and has a visible way past it.
     "Why we ask" is on the screen rather than behind a link, and skipping is
     a real button rather than a greyed-out apology.

   Every animation here is a no-op under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and each act
   is composed so the still frame *is* the finished layout. Nothing is animated
   into existence that is not already laid out where it belongs. */

  /* ---------- act three: the question they came with ----------

     The screen this flow was missing.

     Everything before it establishes *what* somebody tracks, which is the part
     an app can guess at. Nothing anywhere asked *why*, and the why is the only
     fact on this screen worth tailoring around. Two people both pick Eczema:
     one wants to know what sets it off, the other wants to know whether the
     cream she started in January is doing anything. Those are two different
     journals — different extras, different photographs, a different first
     suggestion — and until this screen existed they got the same one.

     Three things make it a decision rather than a survey question:

     - **It answers back with machinery, not encouragement.** Picking one opens
       what the app will actually *do* about it: the comparison it will run,
       the buttons that arrive suggested two screens from now, and the date the
       first answer can appear. Nothing here says "great choice".
     - **Nothing is switched on by it.** Every suggestion it makes is still a
       card somebody has to say yes to, one at a time, on the screens after
       this. An aim moves the app's opinion; it never moves their hand.
     - **"Nothing in particular" is on the screen, last, unpunished.** Somebody
       who wants a record and no theories is not a failure of onboarding, and
       the plan at the end works just as well for them. */

     question is, marks the ones people tracking this usually keep, offers
     all-of-them and none-of-them as single taps for the people who already

  /* ---------- act five: what is worth a photograph ----------

     The old flow asked "photos?" as one tick among six, and then guessed: a
     body map if the pack looked like skin, one front-on progress shot if it
     didn't. Both guesses are wrong for most people. Somebody with IBS wants a
     picture of the plate; somebody on a new cream wants the tub's ingredient
     list; somebody whose ankle swells wants the ankle, and nobody was ever
     going to find that behind a setting called "Photos".

     So the question is not whether but *of what* — and it is asked one subject
     at a time, because eight things a camera can be pointed at is more than
     anybody weighs in a glance, and the cost of getting it wrong is
     asymmetric: a subject nobody picks is a photograph never taken, and there
     is no going back in six weeks to take it.

     Each card is one subject: what it is, what it is worth having later,
     whether people tracking what this person tracks tend to keep it, and a Yes
     beside a No. Both answers move on. Nothing is assumed and nothing arrives
     ticked — every one of these ends with a camera pointed at somebody's own
     skin, plate or bathroom shelf, and an app that arrives having already
     decided which of those it will be asking for has helped itself to a
     decision that was never on offer.

     The contact sheet fills in underneath as the answers land, so "photos: on"
     — which is a setting — never has to stand in for a row of labelled frames,
     which is a journal. */

     A day holds more than a number and a photograph, and every one of the

     That is the whole reason this is walked rather than listed: the row of
     buttons under their thumb for the next year should not be an arrangement
     the app suggested and they never looked at.

     So one card each, a yes beside a no, and the dashboard drawn underneath as
     it assembles. Then the two questions that are not about *what* a day holds
     but about *when* it is asked for — how often, and whether to nudge — in
     that order, because the reminder is about when in the day and the cadence
     is about whether the day is even one of the days, and getting them the
     other way round is how somebody ends up choosing an evening nudge for a
     journal they only meant to keep on Sundays. */

  /* ---------- the last card: bringing in what is already written ----------

     Offered from the end of the flow rather than dropped into the middle of
     it, and never as a step somebody has to get past.

     Almost nobody arrives at a health journal having tracked nothing. It is in
     a notes file, a chat with themselves, a photograph of a page in a
     notebook — months of shorthand that this app can already read into meals,
     doses, numbers and notes *on the dates the notes themselves give*. The
     difference between a journal that opens with one day in it and one that
     opens with ninety is not a nicety: a trend needs days, and days are the
     one thing that cannot be acquired retrospectively by trying harder.

     So the offer is made once, in the only place it can be made honestly —
     after there is a journal to import into — and it is completely truthful
     about the cost: this is the one feature in the app that sends somebody's
     own writing anywhere, it needs the AI connection to exist at all, and
     every proposed row is shown beside the words it came from before a single
     one is written. "Not now" opens the journal and leaves the door in
     Settings, where it always was. */
