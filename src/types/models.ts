/* ---------- the routine: medications, supplements, creams, products ----------

   The third shape that doesn't fit the daily survey, and the one people ask
   for first. A survey question can record *that* you moisturised; it cannot
   record that you used 2 pumps of the CeraVe in the morning, skipped the
   evening one, and have been on 10 mg of the antihistamine since Tuesday.

   Two objects, and the split is the whole design:

   - `RoutineItem` is the *thing* — a medication, a supplement, a cream, a
     shampoo, a shake. It carries the usual dose and when in the day it
     belongs. Editing it changes what today's checklist asks for.
   - `RoutineLog` is one *use* of that thing at one moment. It carries its own
     copy of the name, kind and dose, so renaming an item or deleting it
     outright can never rewrite what a past day says happened. That is the same
     rule the food diary follows, for the same reason: history is a record, not
     a view.

   The dose is a string on purpose. "500 mg", "2 pumps", "a pea-sized amount"
   and "1 scoop" are all things people actually take, and forcing them through
   a number and a unit picker would make the common case slower to serve a
   tidiness nobody asked for. */
